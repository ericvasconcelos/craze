# Craze

Single page of Craze, a great new free theme to showcase your new app.
This application was created using by Pug, SASS, ECMAScript 6 and BrowserSync.

Everything was automated with Gulp, so all code is minified and compressed.
Images can be injected inline, decreasing unnecessary requests.

## Getting Started

To start the project you must have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 7 on your computer.
Open your CLI and go to the root of your project and run:

```
npm install
```

After install all npm packages, run the default task:

```
gulp
```

Go to the page `localhost:3000`

## Observations

Ervery time you need to update your fonts and images, use these commands.

```
gulp font
```

```
gulp imagemin
```
